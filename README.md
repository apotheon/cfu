# C Fu

This project is a catch-all "C practice" repository.  I'm basically just
spraying rust-remover all over my C skills.

I started going through the ANSI C "White Bible" (K&R, *The C Programming
Language*) again, and any excercises I tackle will be included here.

I may also play around with Unix tool implemenations.
